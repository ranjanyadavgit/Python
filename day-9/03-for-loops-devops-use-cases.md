For Loop DevOps use-cases
Server Provisioning and Configuration:

DevOps engineers use "for" loops when provisioning multiple servers or virtual machines with the same configuration. For example, when setting up monitoring agents on multiple servers:

servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")
for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    configure_monitoring_agent "$server"
done
Deploying Configurations to Multiple Environments:

When deploying configurations to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), DevOps engineers can use a "for" loop to apply the same configuration changes to each environment:

environments=("dev" "staging" "prod")
for env in "${environments[@]}"; do
    deploy_configuration "$env"
done
Backup and Restore Operations:

Automating backup and restore operations is a common use case. DevOps engineers can use "for" loops to create backups for multiple databases or services and later restore them as needed.

databases=("db1" "db2" "db3")
for db in "${databases[@]}"; do
    create_backup "$db"
done
Log Rotation and Cleanup:

DevOps engineers use "for" loops to manage log files, rotate logs, and clean up older log files to save disk space.

log_files=("app.log" "access.log" "error.log")
for log_file in "${log_files[@]}"; do
    rotate_and_cleanup_logs "$log_file"
done
Monitoring and Reporting:

In scenarios where you need to gather data or perform checks on multiple systems, a "for" loop is handy. For example, monitoring server resources across multiple machines:

servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")
for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
    check_resource_utilization "$server"
done
Managing Cloud Resources:

When working with cloud infrastructure, DevOps engineers can use "for" loops to manage resources like virtual machines, databases, and storage across different cloud providers.

instances=("instance1" "instance2" "instance3")
for instance in "${instances[@]}"; do
    resize_instance "$instance"
done
